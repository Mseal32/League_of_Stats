# League_of_Stats

## Overview
League of Stats is a software designed (and currently being developed/updated) for a friend that I have released to the public. As can inferred by its name, LOS is a stat tracker: allowing you to enter match data (made for a game whose name bears a strikingly similarity to League of Stats) which the software allows you to view later.

### Features
* Input an entire game: two teams of five players each
* Input a single player on no team
* Track the overall and average stats for each player (Like winrate, KDA ratio, gold, and more!)
  * Including stats for each champion per player
* See and track stats for teams
* Export all data to a formatted PDF

### Upcoming Features
* Customizable UI 
* Compare players and teams by seeing their stats side by side
  * (And mathematically prove who's the better player)
* Better visualize stats by graphing them!
